# Getting started

Before trying to understand pyformatting, you must understand how python formatting works.
Here is some great detailed documentation to read:

1. [Python Formatting Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax)
2. [Formatting Examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples)
3. [Advanced Formatting](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/)

If you think you already know enough about it, you can skip the recommendation, but if you feel that you do not understand something, you should come back here and read the documentation.
